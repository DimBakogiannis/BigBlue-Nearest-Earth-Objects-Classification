# BigBlue-Nearest-Earth-Objects-Classification
Repository for the 3rd project on Supervised ML during my studies in Big Blue Data Academy Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Bootcamp 2023. Engaging with the wonder of space exploration, this repo presents a classification model for NASA's NEOs, distinguishing hazardous ones.

### Dataset used: [NASA - Nearest Earth Objects🚀](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects)
### About the Dataset:
#### Context:☄️
Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth’s neighborhood.Today’s asteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial agglomeration of the inner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

There is an infinite number of objects in the outer space. Some of them are closer than we think. Even though we might think that a distance of 70,000 Km can not potentially harm us, but at an astronomical scale, this is a very small distance and can disrupt many natural phenomena. These objects/asteroids can thus prove to be harmful. Hence, it is wise to know what is surrounding us and what can harm us amongst those. Thus, this dataset compiles the list of NASA certified asteroids that are classified as the nearest earth object.
